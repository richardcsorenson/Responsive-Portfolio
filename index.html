                <p>So I guess I should start by introducing myself, my full name is Richard Charles Sorenson the Third. I was born July 31 1990, third child of Richard Charles Sorenson the Second and Jill Sorenson. I am married to Samantha Sorenson, have been for almost 5 years now and have loved all of it. My early years of life were split between Utah and California, and when I turned 10 my family moved out east to Indiana and later Ohio.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have a fairly normal work history in the sense that like most teenagers I decided to get a part time job to have some extra spending money on the side. I started working for Chick-fil-a in 2007, and became a manager within two years. In 2010 I left Chick-fil-a to serve a 2 year mission for the LDS church in Portland Oregon, where I served in several leadership roles and trained new missionaries several times. In 2012 I returned home and started working for UPS as a package handler (I loaded semi-trucks). After 2 years at UPS I moved to Utah to further my education (also the education of my new wife Samantha). While in Utah I started working for Chick-fil-a again, and have been there for the past 4.5 years.</p>
